    <p>I've been drawn to photography since taking an analog photography class in High School.
      Last year I put my passion to action by investing in a Nikon D7000.</p>
    <p>Photography lets me look inwards and helps me learn more about myself.</p>
    <p>Below are a selection of my shots. Feel free to use them however you'd like. If you'd like larger sizes for your use,
