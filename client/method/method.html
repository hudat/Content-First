        <p>Maybe your company is losing relevancy in your customer's minds.
        Or you're entering a new market and want to create demand.
        Maybe your competitors are closing in.</p>
        <p>I've seen these challenges over and over again. They're patterns that
          every company comes across.</p>
        <p>Having worked through these challenges many times, I began documenting
          them. You see, I wanted to have a response ready for any of these.</p>
        <p>Now, I have a marketing and design methodology that's proven successful across all my projects.
          This methodology includes a library of mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>I have found that products and services that are successful are those that focus on the customer's needs.</p>
          <p>Through a series of rapid fire questions, I unravel the customer's unmet needs. This is the most critical stage of the process; It separates
          products that people love from gimmicks.</p>

          <p>There are 3 core needs that a customer has with any product or service. Customers need to get a job done:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>Faster</li>
              <li>More predictably</li>
              <li>With higher output</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The solutions to these needs vary based on the product or service. By mapping these needs to my
          pattern library, I envision a strategy that gets the job done perfectly.</p>
