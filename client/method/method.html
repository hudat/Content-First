        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Maybe your company is losing relevancy in your customer's minds.
        Or you're entering a new market and want to create demand.
        Maybe your competitors are closing in.</p>
        <p>I've conquered these challenges with companies of all sizes. I take a scientific
          approach to design that results in meaningful products and experiences.</p>

          <p>I have found that products and services are successful when they focus on the customer's unmet needs.</p>
          <p>Through a series of questions, I unravel those needs. This is the most critical stage of the process; It separates
          products that people love from gimmicks.</p>

          <p>There are 3 core needs that a customer has with any product or service. Customers need to get a job done:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>Faster</li>
              <li>More predictably</li>
              <li>With higher output</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The solutions to these needs vary based on the product or service. By mapping these needs to my
          pattern library, I envision a strategy that gets the job done perfectly.</p>
