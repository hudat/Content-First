        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Maybe your company is losing relevancy in your customer's minds.
        Maybe you're entering a new market and want to create demand.
        Or maybe your competitors are closing in.</p>
        <p>I've conquered these challenges with companies of all sizes. I take a scientific
          approach to design that results in meaningful products and experiences.</p>

          <p>I have found that products and services are successful when they focus on the customer's unmet needs.</p>
          <p>Through a series of questions, I unravel those needs. This is the most critical stage of the process as it separates
          products that people love from gimmicks.</p>

          <p>With all the information handy, the strategic thinking begins. Generally, there are three needs
          that a customer has with any product. Customers want to get something done:</p>
            <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>Faster</li>
              <li>More predictably</li>
