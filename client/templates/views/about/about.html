        <p>Over my six years in Product Design, I've had the privilege of working with companies like Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, AMC Networks, WWE and more.</p>
        <p>Prior to his work as a consultant, I helped Fortune 100 clients plan and build software products and services that were used by millions of people.</p>
        <p>I enjoy writing about design, psychology and the intersection of both. You can read some of my essays on my blog. I'm writing my first ebook on the intersection of Psychology
        and UX Design. You can learn more about it here.</p>
