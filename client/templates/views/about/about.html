      <p>I'm a Software Product Design Consultant based in New York City.</p>
        <p class="list-header">I do things like:</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>Lead product teams</li>
            <li>Create product concepts</li>
            <li>Design user interfaces</li>
            <li>Invent better ways to manage design and development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe:</p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>When content drives product development, brands can create meaningful and memorable user experiences</li>
            <li>Teams that quickly and continuously adapt to change develop successful products</li>

        <p>Over my six years in Product Design, I've had the privilege of working with companies like Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, AMC Networks, WWE and more.</p>
        <p>Prior to my consulting work, I managed software teams for Fortune 100 companies and shipped software that's been used by millions of people.</p>
        <p>I enjoy writing about design, psychology, technology and the intersection of the three. You can read some of my essays on <a href="http://blog.husammachlovi.com" title="Husam's Blog">my blog</a>.
